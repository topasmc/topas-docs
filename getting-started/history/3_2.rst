3.2 Series
----------

The main features introduced by the 3.2 series were:

* Option to Score Recursively in Subcomponents
* Volumetric Particle Source
* Auger Cascade
* New Physics Constructors and lists
* Material can now be 4D
* Centering Graphics on a Given Component
* Scaling Graphics by Different Amounts in X, Y an Z
* "power-based" history count

We also updated the underlying Geant4 version to Geant4.10.5.p01.



3.2.2 (2019-08-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed: Reading of XCAT Phantoms and other simple ImageCube implementations
     We have fixed these readings, and ``examples/Patient/XCAT.txt`` now works correctly.



3.2.1 (2019-07-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Fixed:* Incorrect placement of the RT Dose Grid
     A bug was introduced in release 3.2 that caused the RT Dose Grid to be improperly positioned. This is the grid that is automatically created when one uses the parameter ``CloneRTDoseGridFrom``. Placement should now be correct.

*Fixed:* Crash if volumetric source is close to the size of the World
     In some cases, Topas could crash if a volumetric source was close to the edge of the World. Such placement will no longer cause a problem.



3.2.0 (2019-05-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Improved:* Simplified Setting of Environment Variables
     Where you previously had to set a separate environment variable for each of Geant4's many data files, you now just tell TOPAS the location of the overall G4Data directory. You can do this by either one of the following two ways:

     Set one of these two environment variables::

        export TOPAS_G4_DATA_DIR = "/PathToDataDir/G4Data"
        setenv TOPAS_G4_DATA_DIR "/PathToDataDir/G4Data"

     Or set a TOPAS parameter::

        Ts/G4DataDirectory = "/PathToDataDir/G4Data"

     As always, your syntax will depend on where you actually chose to put your data files, and on whether you are using a system that expects "export" versus "setenv" to set environment variables.

*Improved:* DICOM Slice Thickness Attribute is Now Mostly Ignored
     We had previously refused to load a DICOM series if the DICOM slice thickness attribute did not match the actual separation between the individual slice positions. However, we have seen that in many DICOM data sets, this attribute does not correspond to the actual spacing of the slices. We now just ignore this slice thickness attribute, and the only case in which we use the slice thickness attribute is if you only load a single slice (so that there is no possibility for us to compute the actual separation between slices).

*Improved:* Control the Caching of Material Maps for 4D CT
     For 4D CT, the previous TOPAS version always cached all the material maps (a separate map for each CT phase). We did this because we assumed 4D CT users would always want to return to each breathing phase multiple times. However, a user had a case where he had a very large number of maps and only wanted to use each map once. The caching caused him to run out of memory, so a new parameter lets you decide whether such maps should be cached (as before) or not::

        b:Ge/CacheMaterialMapForEachTimeSlice defaults to True

*Fixed:* ``ShowSpecificSlicesVoxel`` Numbering
     The following parameters limit which patient voxels are shown in graphics views. Where slice numbering previously started from 0, it now starts from 1::

        Ge/ShowSpecificSlicesVoxelsX
        Ge/ShowSpecificSlicesVoxelsY
        Ge/ShowSpecificSlicesVoxelsZ

*Improved:* Option to Load a Truncated DICOM, XiO or ImageCube
     The previous parameters, ``ShowSpecificSlicesVoxels``, affected only the graphical output of the voxels. The voxels were still all loaded, and all affected the physics results, but only specific voxels were shown in graphics. These new parameters, ``RestrictVoxels``, have a much more significant effect: they cause TOPAS to not even load some parts of the patient. This can save a lot of time and allow you to test things on DICOM or other image formats quickly, as you only have to load whatever part of the DICOM you actually want to use. But beware: if you use this option, you will change your results. It does not only affect graphics, it actually avoids creating the given voxels at all. Though our main motivation for this work was to get a way to do more rapid development (testing on real patients without the slowdown of loading everything), there may be a value also for our brachytherapy users. They may only need to load the part of the image that is near the brachy source. New parameters allow you to restrict which voxels of a patient image are loaded::

        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsXMin
        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsYMin
        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsZMin
        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsXMax
        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsYMax
        i:Ge/*/RestrictVoxelsZMax

*Improved:* ``ViewAbdoment.txt`` Example has been Sped Up
     We have modified our simplest example of viewing a DICOM, ``examples/Patient/ViewAbdomen.txt`` by applying the new ``RestrictVoxels`` parameters described above.

*Fixed:* XCAT Phantom Reading
     We fixed an issue with attenuation parameters not being read properly.

*Improved:* Energy Binning
     We have understood that some users want to use our energy binning (EBins) for a different thing than we designed. From our proton therapy dose calculation roots, the energy binning that we currently do is based not on the energy of the final particle at hit deposition time but instead on the incident particle energy. This is the energy of the final scored particle, or its ancestor, when that particle or ancestor was first incident on the scoring volume. However, users who have been trying to use this feature to get a spectrum instead need the particle's energy at the current step. So we have now added a parameter to control what kind of energy we use for this binning::

        s:Sc/*/EBinEnergy = "IncidentTrack" # "IncidentTrack", "PreStep" or "DepositedInStep"
        
* "IncidentTrack" is the behavior we have had in the past, the energy that the particle or its ancestor had when it first was incident on the scoring component. This remains the default.
* "PreStep" is the track's energy at the start of the current step.
* "DepositedInStep" is the amount of energy deposited in the current step.
* A new example shows the effect of the three different choices ``examples/Scoring/EnergyDepositBinnedByEnergy.txt``

*Added:* Option to Score Recursively in Subcomponents
     When your scoring component is the parent of other components, you now have the option to set scoring to record particles note only in the parent component, but also in its children. This action is recursive to all levels of subcomponents::

        Sc/MyScorer/PropagateToChildren = "True"
        
*Improved:* Allow nTuple Scorers to Get Binning Information
     A helper method, GetBin, tells scorers which bin was hit within a divided component. This method was previously only available to scorers that implement ``TsVBinnedScorer``. At request of a user, this method has now also been made accessible to scorers that implement ``TsVNTupleScorer``.

*Fixed:* Binning in Variable Density Materials
     A user pointed out that when we generate Variable Density Materials, our binning was slightly off such that the top bin was not quite getting the maximum intended density value. This has been corrected.

*Improved:* Scoring Sensitivity in Some Rare Cases of Complex Geometry Components
     In the past, when components other than TsBox, TsCylinder and TsSphere were made up of more than one volume, scoring was only sensitive in the mother volume. Scoring is now sensitive in all volumes, however this change is unlikely to affect most users. The scoring was already correct in TsBox, TsCylinder and TsSphere.

*Improved:* Redesigned Filtering
     We modified the design of our filters to avoid an issue that was bothering the newer compiler included in Debian 9. The only impact on users is that if you have written your own extension filter, you should modify your filter's constructor to replace ``TsVFiltered*`` filter with ``TsVGenerator*`` generator, ``TsVScorer*`` scorer.

*Added:* Volumetric Particle Source
     A new Particle Source type, Volumetric, has been designed for Brachytherapy applications (though there may be other applications as well). It randomly samples particle starting positions from within the radioactive volume of a given component. When you have a Source of Type "Volumetric", Topas will expect a second parameter::
     
        s:Sc/*/ActiveMaterial
        
     to specify which material within the given component should be considered radioactive. So, for example, if you have:: 

        s:So/Example/Type = "Volumetric"
        s:So/Example/Component = "ActiveSource"
        sc:So/Example/ActiveMaterial = "G4_Ir"
        
     particles will start from randomly sampled positions within the Iridium parts of the component named ActiveSource. See the new example ``examples/Basic/VolumetricSource.txt``

*Added:* New Geometry Component ``TsBrachyApplicator``
     This component represents a gynecological applicator. Parameters control overall dimensions and the number of holes into which one can guide a source wire. See ``examples/Patient/Applicator.txt`` which simulates a Varian VS2000 source wire moving through various dwell positions within a brachytherapy applicator (that is in turn placed within a phantom).

*Improved:* EM Physics Models per Region:
     You can now select different Electromagnetic Physics models in different regions::

        s:Ph/Default/ForRegion/MyRegion2/ActiveG4EmModelFromModule = "g4em-livermore"
        
     New example for EmPhysics models per region ``examples/Basic/EmModelByRegions.txt``

*Added:* Auger Cascade
     Auger Cascade is now supported.

*Added:* New Physics Constructors 
     New Physics Constructors for G4DNA available in Geant4.10.05 have been added to our modular physics list:

* g4em-dna_opt6
* g4em-dna_opt7
* g4em-dna_opt8

*Added:* New Physics Lists
     New Physics Lists that artificially maintain constant the incident particle kinetic energy (frozen-velocity approximation), ensuring the correct calculation of stopping power:
     
* g4em-dna-stationary
* g4em-dna-stationary_opt2
* g4em-dna-stationary_opt4
* g4em-dna-stationary_opt6

*Improved:* Variance Reduction
     We added several new features to Variance Reduction:
     
* The capability to change VR parameters (e.g. split number) using time features.
* The capability of have more than one VR per simulation (e.g. uniform splitting + imp sampling)
* Forced interaction VR

*Added:* New manager for generic biasing process
     A new virtual class ``TsVBiasingProcess`` facilitates the integration of new VRs. Current parameters for VR are still functional, but now they can be renamed different than ``Vr/ParticleSplit/XYZ``

*Improved:* Examples for secondary biasing
     We added several new examples for secondary biasing 

* New example for forced interaction ``examples/VarianceReduction/ForcedInteraction.txt``
* New example showing cross-section enhancement for bremsstrahlung ``examples/VarianceReduction/CrossSectionEnhancement.txt``
* New example showing importance sampling and bremsstrahlung splitting ``examples/VarianceReduction/ImportanceSamplingSecondaryBiasing.txt``
* Also shows the capabilities of having more than one VR in the same simulation.

*Fixed:* Obscure Problem with Component Placement
     Components were incorrectly placed when the first component in a parallel world was a Group Component. Interestingly, we never had any reports of this problem from users. It was only found during some of our own special tests.

*Added:* Forbid Use of Parallel Worlds with Chemistry
     Since Geant4 DNA's chemistry processes do not support parallel worlds, we have added a check to forbid use of parallel worlds if chemistry is turned on in your physics list.

*Fixed:* Diagnostic Printout of TsPropeller Component
     The TsPropeller component has a diagnostic that prints out its angle. Where this was meant to print out the full angle, it was actually printing the half-angle. This has been corrected. 

*Added:* Material can now be 4D
     You can now change a component's material over time. You can also change the material that is specified in the ``DoseToMaterial`` scorer (though we don't know why you might want to do this).

*Added:* Centering Graphics on a Given Component
     A new graphics parameter allows you to center the view on a given component::

        s:Gr/*/CenterOn = "MyComponent"
        
     Topas will then ignore any parameters of the form: ``Gr/*/TransX`` or ``Gr/*/TransY``

*Added:* Scaling Graphics by Different Amounts in X, Y an Z
     New parameters allow you to scale by different amounts in each dimension::

        uv:Gr/*/Scale = 3 1. 2. 3.
        
     would scale by 1 in X, by 2 in Y and by 3 in Z.

*Improved:* Zooming to the Nanometer Scale
     With very large ``Gr/*/Zoom`` values, as one might use to zoom into the nano scale, floating point errors in the graphics card lead to discontinuous jumps in the image position. This makes it difficult to center or size the view as one wishes, but an easy workaround has been understood. If one simply makes the world invisible, then because the initial graphics extent only includes the nanometer scale components, one doesn't need much zoom. This effect and its solution are demonstrated in the new example ``examples/Graphics/NanoMeterScaleTest.txt``

*Improvemed:* Controlling Console Output
     You can add time stamps to the history count::
     
        b:Ts/IncludeTimeInHistoryCount = "True"

*Added:* You can have a "power-based" history count ``b:Ts/ShowHistoryCountLessFrequentlyAsSimulationProgresses``
     After first ten histories, output will change to once for every 10, then to once for every 100, etc. An additional optional parameter, ``i:Ts/MaxShowHistoryCountInterval``, puts an upper limit on how high the ``ShowHistoryCountInterval`` can be. For example::
     
        b:Ts/ShowHistoryCountLessFrequentlyAsSimulationProgresses
        i:Ts/MaxShowHistoryCountInterval = 100
        
     Gives: 1, ,2, 3...9, 10, 20, 30...100 but from there always keep counting by 100 (rather than going on to counting by 1000, 10,000, etc.)

*Improved:* Handling of Mapped Magnetic Fields
     Thanks to several users, we have identified and improved some aspects of the ``MappedMagnet`` field reader. The system now works for a wider variety of field maps and allows for 4D changes in the map.

*Improved:* Increased the Default ``Ts/MaxStepNumber``
     TOPAS watches the number of steps on tracks to try to detect tracks that are stuck endlessly looping. The limit is set by the parameter ``Ts/MaxStepNumber``. We have found cases where legitimate tracks take more than 100K steps, so we have increased the default limit from 100K to 1M.

*Improved:* Made Parameter File Reading be More Robust
     We now catch and replace smart quotes (single and double) with simple double quotes. We also now catch and replace various Unicode hyphen characters with minus sign.
