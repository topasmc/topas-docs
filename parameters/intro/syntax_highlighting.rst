Syntax highlighting
-------------------

It can be very useful to have a text editor capable of performing syntax highlighting.
The following editors currently support topas syntax highlighting:

- `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_:
  Go to Packages >> Settings View >> Install Packages/Themes, and search for topas. This package should recognise both *.tps and *.topas files and highlight them automatically. Otherwise you have to manually turn on syntax highlighting in the bottom right of your screen
- `Sublime text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_:
  open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p on Mac, ctrl+shift+p on Linux/Windows)
  select Package Control: Install Package
  search for Topas Syntax
- `Vim <https://www.vim.org/>`_:
  see `here <https://github.com/murdock-grewar/topas-vim>`_ for instructions
- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_: Go to Extensions (ctrl+shift+x) and search for Topas. Choose the Extension "Topas" by Samuel Peet and select "Install", then reload Visual Studio Code
